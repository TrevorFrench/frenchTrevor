 <h3>Stock Overview: Hawaiian Electric Industries, Inc. (NYSE: HE)<hr></h3>
 <p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hawaiian Electric is a utilities company that serves the Hawaiian Islands. Currently, HE is trading at $44.35. Here are a few things that investors should be paying attention to:
<br>
<br>
<ul>
  <li>Fiscal Year 2019 is the first year that HE has raised dividends since 1998 despite its share price growing approximately 140% since then.</li>
  <br>
  <li>It is a highly defensive stock with a beta of 0.17 (3Y monthly) as of today.</li>
  <br>
  <li>It has a payout ratio of about 67.4%.</li>
  <br>
  <li>The forward dividend yield for FY2019 is projected to be 2.92%.</li>
  <br>
  <li>The company has made every dividend payment since at least 1990 (you can see its dividend history <a href="http://www.hei.com/Dividend">here</a>).</li>
</ul>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The company has been in business since 1891 and has a strong hold on the market in which it operates. Despite the lack of pressure from competition, HE has continued to innovate and invest in Hawaii’s grid. Although, there isn’t much dividend growth and the yield is modest, Hawaiian Electric should not be written off by value investors looking for a safe investment to round out their portfolios. This stock also has a unique value proposition for growth investors searching for hedges.
